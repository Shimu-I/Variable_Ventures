            Undefeated, uh-huh
            That's why they call me undisputed, uh-huh
            I'm rankin' up another season, uh-huh
            I been about my stats, now, would you look at that?

            Uh, undefeated, locked and loaded, we about to blow
            Caught 'em with that left-right, leave 'em tapped out on the floor
            三 二 一, sticky swishy, watch me bank a score
            Up in the board (yeah), I'm up in the zone, yeah, yeah

            Gojira, fire the breath (ha)
            King of the jungle, I'm beating my chest
            They say I'm posing a threat (threat big)
            Just took a dub, and I'm cutting the net

            Ring on my finger, baguettes ('guettes)
            Like playing chess, and I don't even sweat
            That's what I call a finesse
            That's what I call a finesse

            Ain't no rivals, ain't no rivals
            They can try, but they're never ever slowing me down
            On arrival this is my show
            Crossing my heart, they know we are

            Undefeated, uh-huh
            That's why they call me undisputed, uh-huh
            I'm rankin' up another season, uh-huh
            I been about my stats, now, would you look at that?
